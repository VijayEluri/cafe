I'm wondering if Markdown is going to be better about line breaks, or if I'm
going to have the same issues I've had with Textile.

 * Wondering if line breaks work with lists.
 * I saw Markdown doing the smart thing with comments in a git comment that got
   shuffled to Lighthouse.
 * Will that work here? Markdown is inspired by email.

This is my markdown entry. Let's see where it gets me.
